# AgriTech -  USGS LIDAR Challenge

### Introduction
AgriTech is interested in how water flows through a maize field. This helps improve research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

### Objective
This project aims to build an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module for AgriTech that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data. 

### Functionalities
* Interface with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API
* Query the data model
* Terrain visualization
* Data transformation
